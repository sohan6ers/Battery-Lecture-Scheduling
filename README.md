# Prediction and Optimisation for Renewable Energy Scheduling in the Monash Microgrid
This is Data Science Team 10's code and approach for the project: 'Prediction and Optimisation for Renewable Energy Scheduling in the Monash Microgrid.' 

## Forecast
5 different models for forecasting solar/building series values were built. Of those 5, we decided on an ARIMA model due to our past experience of using it.


## Website

The visualisations of the outputs from the optimisation model was coded into the website. We used a NiceAdmin template to build off from and Vegalite to help visualise the outputs.
